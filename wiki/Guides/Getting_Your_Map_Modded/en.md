# How to get your map modded

Getting your map [modded](/wiki/Modding) is an essential step in the [ranking process](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). There are multiple ways to accomplish this task.

## Types of mods

Before you get into finding mods, you must first understand the different types of mod requests you can make. The two most commonly used mod request types are [normal mod request](/wiki/Modding/Normal_mod) (NM req) and [mod for mod request](/wiki/Modding/Mod_for_mod) (M4M req). These are not the only request types though, there are a few other mod request types that are mainly used in #modreqs. These are the other request types:

- **Beatmap Nominator request (BN req):** Used only in Beatmap Nominator queues or in #modreqs, a BN request is used when you believe your map can not be improved by regular mods anymore, and requires a more experienced look at your map from a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators).
- **Metadata check (Meta check):** Fairly self-explanatory, the [modder](/wiki/Modding/Modder) will check that the metadata of your map is correct. Metadata is often checked in regular mods too.
- **Hitsound check:** The modder will check your map to make sure that your hitsounding represents the song correctly, is consistent, and is up to ranking standards.

## Modding queues

Posting your map in modding queues is the most effective, and most widely used, way of finding people to mod your maps. Modding queues are threads posted in the [Modding Queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60) forum that allow the creator of the thread to find maps to mod, and for others to easily find modders to mod their maps. Using the modding queues forum to find mods is straightforward and effective, follow these steps to get started:

1. Open the [Modding Queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60) page in your web browser.
2. Have a look through the list of queues and find one that accepts maps from the game mode you have mapped, and make sure it is marked as "open" in the title or post.
3. Read the queue's rules, if you or your map does not meet the requirements listed there, then unfortunately you'll have to find another queue to post in.
4. Read the modder's preferences listed in the queue (if any), it may save both you and the creator of the queue a lot of time.
5. Click the `go to last post` button at the bottom of the screen. This is represented by the double right arrow icon.
6. Type what sort of request you would like, along with a link to your beatmap and any other information the modder has asked you to provide, into the `New reply` box.
7. Click `Post` when you are finished.

It is generally acceptable to post in a few modding queues at a time, so feel free to repeat this process if necessary, or if you want to boost your chances of receiving a mod. Keep in mind, just because you have posted in a modding queue, does not mean the modder is obligated to mod your map, they will mod it if they want to.

It is worth noting that you should avoid posting in Beatmap Nominator's queues until your mapping is at a near rankable level (unless they have specified they are looking for newer mappers), as they will likely always ignore your requests otherwise. You are much better off finding normal modders to mod your maps when you are still learning how to map.

## #modreqs

#modreqs is a channel in the osu! chat where players can request mods on their maps by linking them with the `/np` command, along with a mod request type. While it is not the most effective method of finding mods, modders and Beatmap Nominators are often on the lookout for good maps being linked in this channel to mod.

#modreqs does not have the same functionality and userbase that it has had in the past, but it is still a useful method for obtaining mods, so it is worth a shot. While it is still full of normal mod requests, these days it is also commonly used for the other request types mentioned above in [types of mods](/wiki/Guides/Getting_Your_Map_Modded#types_of_mods).

*Warning: Do not spam requests in this channel, post a mod request in #modreqs once every hour or so.*

## Directly asking other users

Directly asking other users is a great way to get mods too. Generally, if a modder does not have a modding queue, they will likely have their modding information in the Me! section of their profile. After reading any information they have there, you can then message them in osu! chat with your request. While these modders are harder to come by, there are still some out there, a lot of which have private queues off-platform and such.

All Beatmap Nominators have their modding information on their Me! pages, regardless of if they have a modding queue or not. Asking Beatmap Nominators directly is almost a necessity in getting one to mod and/or nominate your map. 

Possibly the simplest method of getting a mod, albeit with varying degrees of quality, is asking your friends to mod your map. You will probably want to ask friends who at least have a little mapping experience to get the best results.
